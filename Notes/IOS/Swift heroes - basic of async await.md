# [[Swift heroes - basic of async await]]


__`swift` [[concurrency]] features pre [[async await]] :__

- GCD - [[grand central dispatch]]
- Completion Blocks
- [[Combine#Promises and Futures]] 


before we start talking about async await api , it is important to understand the problem it is trying to solve: 
most of the time we developer are writing a synchronous code , but in some cases where we need more efficiency for our features, we might want to write asynchronous code to complete the task faster. this have advantages and disadvantages when the main cons to this approaches is "__closure Hell__" which make the code very unreadable. 
![[Pasted image 20220416133524.png]]

## async await basic
[[async await]] is a new syntax for concurrency which is a well defined and used across many other programming languages. (each with its own implementation). 

#### async
__async__ word let you define asynchronous functions for example:
`func loadImage() async throws -> UIImage` 
when before this syntax we would mostly use: 
`func loadImage(completion: (Result<UIImage, Error>)->Void)`

#### await 
__await__ let you wait for the result (simple right?) of an asynchronous function for example : 
```swift
do {
	self.image = try await person.loadImage()
} catch {
	handleError(error)
}
```
(assuming that load image have an [[#async context]] using the [[#async]] word mentioned above).


#### Asynchronous context
an async function can only be called within an async context. in [swift] there are two main async context we can use: 
- [[#async]] syntax on a function.
- [[Task]] - allow you to create async context for non- async methods. (you can read more in [[#Task]] headline) 
```swift
func updatePersonInfo() {
	Task {
		do {
		  let image = try await person.loadImage()
		}catch{}
	}
}
```

#### replace closure hell with await
![[Pasted image 20220416143017.png|600]]

each await represent a completion block. this is a good syntax because it seems like a sync code but each of the await actually __suspends__ and waits for the result before resuming to the next steps.


## async await under the hood
### Task 
A [Task] is represents a unit of asynchronous work which could be a child of a different __Task__. It has several init that let us create a new [[#Asynchronous context]]  :
- `Task {...}`
- `Task(priority) {...}`
those init execute async but on the context they inherit (for example putting a task in a view controller will still run on main thread).
- `Task.detached{...}` will just run on some thread without inherit the context it is calling. 

Task is actually generic over __Success__ and __Failure__ but the default is __Void__ and __Never__. 
`Task {...} = Task<Void, Never> {...}`
you can return a value using a task like the following : 

```swift
let task = Task<String, Never> {
	return asyncString()
}
let result = await task.value
```

### Cooperative Thread Pool 
unlike what most might think. this api is not just a cool wrapper to GCD. the new concurrency module use a concept calls [__Cooperative Thread Pool__](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~abadi/Papers/popl065-abadi.pdf)  model.
- A pool of threads available to run async functions 
- Tasks must always make forward progress of suspend. that means that you cant just use a Task to block a thread in some context. it can go forward doing some computation in the context or suspend in order to wait for a computation result.
- no more than one thread per CPU core. In GCD this is not the case which can cause a thread explosion during blocking.
- Avoid the overhead and performance penalty of  thread switching .

__the most important thing is that the cooperative thread pool can suspend tasks and resume them later. this is due to an abstraction called [[#Continuation]].

when we mark a function as [[#async]] , swift know it can "suspend" and wait for result. than it can resume as needed, while other async function utilize threads in the pool.

![[Pasted image 20220416150733.png]]

## Error handling
before, we would just kept checking for errors in each closure and check what kind of error it is and handle activation of the next block accordingly. 

in async await api however it feels way more synchronous and natural : 
```swift 
do {
	try await async()
	try await async2()
	try await async3()
}catch let error {}
```
if any of the task fails, consecutive tasks will simply no run or cancel. the  `error` above will be the instance the Task in each async method will be sending.  
* should mention that the compiler and runtime prevents you from not returning a value or an error which this is a perk you would not get if using closures. 


## Async getters 
a variable can also be async: 
```swift
struct Person {
	let avatarURL : URL 
	var avatarImage : UIImage?{
		get async throws {
			let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: avatarURL)
			return UIImage(data: data)
		}
	}
}

//use case: 
let saar = Person(url: url)
profileImage.image = try await saar.avatarImage
```


## Cool use case used in MONDAY : 
[JWT](https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/JWT) refresh functionality can be tricky using completion blocks flow. (mostly use for user validation when authenticate). 
![[Pasted image 20220416152227.png]]


## Using async await in parallel
sometimes we want to run tasks without binding them to each other, before we would user [[procedure kit]] or [[Dispatch Groups]] 

Dispatch group example: 
![[Pasted image 20220416152841.png]]

##### async let bindings
let us run multiple independent tasks in parallel, while awaiting all of their results together. (you dont have to wait for the results if not needed).
```swift
func updatePersonInfo(_ persion: Persion) async {
	async let image = person.loadImage()
	async let count = person.loadInvitesCount()
	async let friends = person.loadFriends()

await handleInfo(image, count, friends)
}
```

## Cancellation 
async/await uses a [Cooperative Cancellation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/threading/cancellation-in-managed-threads) mechanism. This means that each task is responsible to short circuit its own execution if its cancelled.

you can check cancellation in a task with the following : 
* `try Task.checkCancellation()` this throws a special CancellationError if the task was canceled and stops the control flow.
* handle the cancellation yourself with `if Task.isCancelled {...}`
*  `try await withTaskCancellationHandler(operation: {...}, onCancel: {...})` you can add a cancellation block to a Task


## Task groups 
we might have a data structure to posses a some sort of data model objects. and we want each of those objects to perform a long async computed task (for example : load all current logged in user profile picture )

we might be tempted to do the following: 
```swift
func getAllUserPhotos() async -> [UIImage] {
	var result = [UIImage] ()
	for person in people {
		await result.append(person.loadAvatar())	
	}
	return result
}
```

this will work , how ever it will be synchronized for each person in the collection which will hurt performance.

__what about [[#async let bindings]]?__
async let will work only if we know how many tasks we will execute (so we can later add all of them to an await result)

#### Enter Task groups: 
a task group as the name suggests, group together other child tasks in a hierarchical way (similar to [[procedure kit#group procedure]])
``` swift
await withTaskGroup(of: ...) {group in}
await withThrowingTaskGroup(of: ...) {group in}


// of is the type of each child task result. so that means child tasks are embedded to the type of the task group.

await withTaskGroup(ofL UIImage.self) {group in
for person in people {
 group.addTask(priority: person.isImportant ? .high : nil ) {await person.loadAvatar()}
 }

 var results = [UIImage].init()
 for await image in group {
   results.append(image)
 }
return results
}
```
this code will reach to the return line if all async code return data.  if one of the task fails the group fails unless we handle it differently.
*  you can also give priority base on the model object data
* results might return in any order, so its worth sorting or keeping track of the different task somehow.

### Structured & unstructured Concurrency 
![[Pasted image 20220416193236.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220416193424.png]]

## Async Sequences 
 up until now, we dealt with async functions that return a single result. 
some times, we might have async work that will return multiple values : Sockets, Publishers and more...

[[AsyncSequence]] is similar ti regular Swift Sequence, except that every value is __awaited asynchronously__ .

we saw it in the [[#Task groups]] code above .
``` swift
for await image in group {
	result.append(image)
}
```
### some methods async sequences is used 
- [[URLSession]] bytes api
``` swift
let (bytes, _) = try await URLSession.shared.bytes(for: URLRequest(url: largeCSV))

var peopple = [Person]()
try await line in bytes.line {
	people.append(Person(csvLine: line))
}
```
this code precesses the lines lazily, while the data transfer is ongoing.

- FileHandle api - instead of reading the entire file synchronously and than parse the lines we can do the following:
``` swift 
let handle = try FileHandle(forReadingFrom : localFile)
var people = [Person]()
for try await line in handle.bytes.lines {
	people.append(Person(csvLine: line))
}
```
this reads the lines one by one using the __bytes__ api mentioned above.


### what is exactly AsyncSequence? 
its simply a protocol, we can conform it and make our own async sequence... check [[#conforming to AsyncSequence]].
![[Pasted image 20220416194817.png]]

## Actors 
working with [[Actors]] is a very wide and deep topic, in this article i will only touch the basics. 
if you like to see more , you should visit the [WWDC relevant sessions about the subject](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10133/)

one of the most problematic things to get right when working async is [Data Races](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition). as you might already know, data races usually involved shared mutable state, when 2 or more threads trying to access that state at the same time, and at least one of these accesses is a write.

![[Pasted image 20220416195938.png]]

while value types can help a lot in data races, usually we solve them with more involved mechanisms: 
- [NSLock](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nslock) , [NSRecursiveLock](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsrecursivelock) 
- [Serial Dispatch Queue](https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/concurrent-serial-dispatchqueue/)
those mechanisms are very hard to get right... 

Actor are reference type objects (like classes) that provide automatic synchronization and isolation for its state.

__concurrent read/write races are very common in even the simplest of scenarios__ 

when using actor and try to access data without await we will get this error: 
![[Pasted image 20220417000338.png]]

the way to fix this is to use a detached Task.. (we will soon explain the meaning of this error) __functions in actors are automatically async__ 

```swift
let ds = DataSource()
Task.detached {await ds.next()}
```

## @MainActor
There is another special kind of actor called __The Main Actor__. In some way, it a representation  of the main Thread.

![[Pasted image 20220417000734.png]]

you can annotate specific methods or even entire types with @MainActor, to make sure they always run on main thread:

```swift 
@MainActor class SomeViewModel {
	func updateUI(){
		//this will run on main Thread
	}
	nonisolated func networking(){
		// nonisolated means the code will not be isolated for main thread only
	}
}
```

this is the actor concepts on the tip of the iceberg and there are much more to discuss when understanding the isolated context and actor "true story"
- @Sendable 
- @globalActor
- @precconcurrency
- and much more...

## Creating your own continuation 
so far we talked about existing [[#async]] functions, but sometimes when we work with legacy we might want to wrap our closures api with async context and continuation. 
we can do that with those build in function: 
![[Pasted image 20220417001725.png]]
__most of the time we will use the first two options, all do the same but the first help with runtime safety for continuation mechanism__ (you cant resume continuation more than once)

for example assume we have the following legacy load image function 
`func loadImage(completion: (Result<UIImage, Error>)->Void)`
we can wrap is as an async function like so: 
```swift
func loadImage() async throws -> UImage {
	try await withCheckedThrowingContinuation { continuation in 
		switch result {
		  case .success(let image): 
			  continuation.resume(returning: image)
		
		  case .failure(let error):
			  continuation.resume(throwing: error)
		}
	}
}
```
 
 if you are using the swift Result type you can just send it like that: ``continuation.resume(with: result)


## Creating our own Async Sequence
as mentioned before, [[#Async Sequences]] is simply a protocol.
luckily, we dont need to implement it ourself. we can use __AsyncStream__

#### AsyncStream

assuming we want to build a program to update stock changes base on a stock collection that we fetched prior, when there are no stocks in the collection case finished will be sent.
```swift
enum StockChange {
 case change(Stock)
 case finished

  func monitorStocks(stockChange: (StockChange) -> Void){....}
}
```

with AsyncStream we can implement this behavior easily : 

```swift 
func monitorStocks() -> AsyncStream<Stock> {
	AsyncStream<Stock> {continuation in 
	   monitorStocks { change in
		 switch change {
		   case .change (let stock):
		    continuation.yield(stock)
		   case .finished:
			   continuation.finish()
		 }
	   }
	}
}

// implementation of the stream 
Task {
	for await stock in monitorStocks() {
	  print("current stock:" \(stock))
	}
}
```

notice we use yield this time because we have a sequence of objects we want to stream out (and resume can occurs only once)
![[Pasted image 20220417003453.png]]

## Objective-C [Interoperability](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/interoperability) 
for [[Objective-C]] the swift Compiler automatically generated async versions of block-based methods: 

```objc
-(void)fetchNumbers:(void(^)(NSArray<NSNumber *>*>))completion;

```
the swift runtime will create the following: 
![[Pasted image 20220417004113.png]]

you can even use [[preprocessor macros]] to generate a different method names...
![[Pasted image 20220417004317.png]]

##### why is this important? 
well that just means that most of apple code that have completion handlers gets free bridging to __async/await__. (-: 


## SwiftUI 
To execute async functions from within your [[SwiftUI]] code, you can simply use the new [[.task]] modifier (IOS 15+)

##### IOS 15+ 
this will run on the view onAppear life cycle method behind the scene
``` swift 
struct MyView : View {
	@State var numbers = [Int]()

	var body: some View {
		Text("\(numbers.count) numbers")
		 .task {
			 self.numbers = await fetchNumbers
		 }
	}
}
```

##### IOS 13+ 
``` swift 
struct MyView : View {
	@State var numbers = [Int]()

	var body: some View {
		Text("\(numbers.count) numbers")
		 .OnAppear {
		   Task { @MainActor in 
		      self.numbers = await fetchNumbers()
		   }
		 }
	
	}
}
```

__should notice ios 15 code help with cancellation and much more the other code does not, how ever in most cases both will generate same result.__

## [[Combine]] and Async/Await
we saw [[#Async Sequences]] which is very similar to [[Combine#Publisher]].
we can use a publisher this way using the __values__ property: 

#### combine & sink 
``` swift
numbers
.map {$0*2}
.prefix(3)
.dropFirst()
.sink(
  recieveCompletion: {_ in print("Done!")},
  receiveValue: {print("Value \($0)")}
).store(in: &subscription)
```

##### Combine & async/await:
```swift 
let publishers = numbers
.map{ $0*2 }
.prefix(3)
.dropFirst()

for await number in publisher.values {
  print("Value \(number)")									  
}

print("Done!")
```

`values` - turns the publisher into an async sequence 

## swift-async-algorithem 
[[Combine]] had all those awesome operators we all grew to love.  but how do we use them on [[async await]]? 
Apple seems to be shifting its focus heavily towards async/await, as evident by their latest release of [swift-async-algorithem](https://github.com/apple/swift-async-algorithms) a set of combine-like operators for [[#Async Sequences]].
