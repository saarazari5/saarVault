# [[Testing In Java]]
for performing [[unit test]] in java we mainly use: [[JUnit]] framework.

Testing is the process of checking the functionality of an application to ensure it runs as per requirements.

Unit testing plays a critical role in helping a software company deliver quality products to its customers.
