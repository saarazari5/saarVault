# [[JUnit]]
JUnit is a unit testing framework for Java programming language. It plays a crucial role test-driven development, and is a family of unit testing frameworks collectively known as xUnit.

JUnit promotes the idea of "first testing then coding", which emphasizes on setting up the test data for a piece of code that can be tested first and then implemented. This approach is like "test a little, code a little, test a little, code a little." It increases the productivity of the programmer and the stability of program code, which in turn reduces the stress on the programmer and the time spent on debugging.

## Features 
-   JUnit is an open source framework, which is used for writing and running tests.
    
-   Provides annotations to identify test methods.
    
-   Provides assertions for testing expected results.
    
-   Provides test runners for running tests.
    
-   JUnit tests allow you to write codes faster, which increases quality.
    
-   JUnit is elegantly simple. It is less complex and takes less time.
    
-   JUnit tests can be run automatically and they check their own results and provide immediate feedback. There's no need to manually comb through a report of test results.
    
-   JUnit tests can be organized into test suites containing test cases and even other test suites.
    
-   JUnit shows test progress in a bar that is green if the test is running smoothly, and it turns red when a test fails.
