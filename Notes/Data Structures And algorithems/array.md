# [[array]]
The array is a type of data structure that stores elements of the same type. These are the most basic and fundamental data structures. Data stored in each position of an array is given a positive value called the index of the element. The index helps in identifying the location of the elements in an array.

If supposedly we have to store some data i.e. the price of ten cars, then we can create a structure of an array and store all the integers together. This doesnâ€™t need creating ten separate integer variables. Therefore, the lines in a code are reduced and memory is saved. The index value starts with 0 for the first element in the case of an array.

## indexing an element 
the good thing in array is indexing an element is always in $O(1)$. due to the fact its a fixed size array with same jumps in memory from object to object base on the size of the type of the array.

## searching an element
* in general array : $O(n)$
* in sorted array : [[binary search]] $O(logn)$
